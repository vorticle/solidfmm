March 5th, 2023:

I changed jobs and left academia, solidfmm's main download source will
now be GitHub.

I added functionality to compute minimal bounding spheres. I am
considering to add further functionality to solidfmm, potentially
I will include a full FMM implementation. Next step will be an
automatic scheduler for translations on multi-core machines.


July 22nd, 2022:

I will be leaving the university in October 2022. The recommended Download
source "Sciebo", my university's cloud server, might become unavailable after
this point in time. I am looking for alternatives at the moment to post tarballs
somewhere else.

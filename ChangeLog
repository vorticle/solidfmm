October 29th, 2021: solidfmm-1.0.

Initial Release of solidfmm.


===============================================================================
November 9th, 2021: solidfmm-1.1.

Added support for AVX-512. Double precision versions of both AVX and AVX-512
now use a different algorithm for reading solids into the thread local buffers
and back. In effect, the necessary matrix transposition is done in a vectorised
fashion in the processor registers now. At P = 20 this trick gives about
15-20% increase in performance.


===============================================================================
January 24th, 2022: solidfmm-1.2.

The most important change of this release is the addition of a detailed user guide
in the doc folder. This user-guide supersedes the previous HOWTO file. The developer
guide is still work-in-progress, the user guide is fairly complete. Up to typos,
that is.

Additionally, solidfmm now also supports vector-valued expansions and the
evaluation of the gradients of the solid harmonics R and S. This code has
been already in solidfmm-1.1, but was not documented and still contained bugs.
This has changed in this released: the code is tested and its usage is
documented in the user guide.

A very minor addition to the operator_handle interface: make_buffer() generates
matching buffer_handles for the given operator_handle. 

===============================================================================
July 22nd, 2022: solidfmm-1.3.

This release contains several improvements.
- Fixed a bug with aligned_alloc on certain systems.
- Expanded the user guide with a section on writing microkernels.
- Added optimised implementation for ARMv8-A in double precision.
- Some more minor optimisations in the AVX code for x86 CPUs.
    - Replaced vzeroall with vxorpd
    - Full assembly implementation of swap(), replacing the previously
      used intrinsics-based version.
- Added missing m4 macros for generating the build system using
  autoreconf --install


===============================================================================
March 5th, 2023: solidfmm-1.4.

- Added assembly implementation for single precision on ARMv8-A.
- Improved the double precision zm2m and zm2l microkernel methods for ARMv8-A. 
  On my Raspberry Pi they now deliver 98% of the theoratical peak performance.
- Added sphere.hpp and sphere.cpp, lets you compute minimal bounding spheres.
- Expanded benchmark_microkernel to also benchmark the zm2m routine.
- Fixed typos in the documentation.
- Code should now compile without warnings when using -Wall -Wextra

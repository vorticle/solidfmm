October 29th, 2021: Initial Release of solidfmm.



November 9th, 2021: solidfmm-1.1.

Added support for AVX-512. Double precision versions of both AVX and AVX-512
now use a different algorithms for reading solids into the thread local buffers
and back. In effect, the necessary matrix transposition is done in a vectorised
fashion in the processor registers now. At P = 20 this trick gives about
15-20% increase in performance.

solidfmm's documentation is written using LaTeX. By default, solidfmm comes
with the readily compiled PDF containing its documentation.

If you want to edit the documentation, you will need a TeX distribution to
compile it yourself. How to install such a distribution is beyond the scope
of this project: it depends on the operating system you are
using, and many guides on how to do this can be found on the internet.

Once you have installed your favourite LaTeX distribution, you can compile
the document by issuing the following commands in *this* folder:

lualatex solidfmm
biber solidfmm
lualatex solidfmm
lualatex solidfmm

This should produce the file solidfmm.pdf, which you can read with
any PDF reader of your choice.
